# Early Dementia Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to detect early stages of dementia using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By analyzing brain imaging data, this model aims to provide a reliable and efficient method for early diagnosis, which can help in timely intervention and treatment.

## Features
- Custom CNN model for dementia classification.
- Fine-tuned model (`cnn_model_fintuned.h5`) for improved performance.
- Web application for real-time predictions using uploaded MRI images.
- Outputs dementia classification results along with prediction accuracy.

## Workflow
1. **Training the Model**  
   Run `cnn_model.py` to train the model:
   ```bash
   python cnn_model.py
   ```
   Before running, ensure that the file `cnn_model_fintuned.h5` is removed from the directory to start fresh. Once training completes, a new `cnn_model_fintuned.h5` file will be generated.

2. **Updating the Prediction Script**  
   After obtaining `cnn_model_fintuned.h5`, copy its relative path and update the file path in `cnn_predict.py`. Run the prediction script:
   ```bash
   python cnn_predict.py
   ```
   This will evaluate the model and provide prediction accuracy.

3. **Launching the Web Application**  
   Start the web application by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The terminal will display a link, such as:
   ```
   Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
   Copy and paste this link into a web browser (preferably Chrome) to access the application.

4. **Uploading an MRI Image**  
   In the web application, navigate to the MRI Scanning section and upload an image of the brain. The model will predict whether dementia is present and display the results.

5. **Output Image**
   After uploading the MRI image, the model will display the output image showing the brain scan with the prediction result. Here's an example output:
   - **Predicted Result:** Dementia Present / No Dementia
   - **Prediction Confidence:** 70% to 80% (or another percentage based on your model's accuracy)

   Example of the output:

   *This is a sample output image showing the brain scan and the prediction result.*

   The result will also show the classification of the image, whether it predicts the presence of dementia, and the prediction's confidence score.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dementia-detection.git
   cd dementia-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed.


> **Note:** Replace the above placeholder with an actual image link or upload your example image directly to the repository.

## Results
- Accuracy obtained after running `cnn_predict.py`: **(mention accuracy, e.g., 70% to 80%)**
- Outputs include predictions and class probabilities.

You can replace the placeholder example output with the actual result you get from your web app once it's fully functional. You can also upload a sample output image (or the result image after prediction) to the repository and link it like I have done with the sample MRI image.
